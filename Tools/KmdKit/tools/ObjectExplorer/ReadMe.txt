ObjectExplorer v1.0

Let you browse the Windows NT Object Manager namespace.
I've stopped to develope this tool in assembly and moved all stuff to c.
While porting the code i've discovered some hidden bugs (resources leak, etc...).
All bugs was killed of course but the asm code was untouched.
So bugs are still there. Sorry, but i have no time to do this job.
The next much more functional version of ObjectExplorer comming soon.

Mistakes I have committed:

KdPrint need two pairs of parenthesis, but I don't.

When it comes to initialize the event, it ought to be set to FALSE,
    OR the driver will exit directly without any delay, regardless of if its child thread has done its work.
KeInitializeEvent( &s_event, SynchronizationEvent, FALSE);

I don't know why the me-defined function named "MySleep" is not work,
      and don't know why it triggeres an BSOD(Blue Screen Of Death) after frequently start/stop the Service

My codes firstly runs
	KeSetEvent( &s_event, 0, TRUE );

Then delays, which leads to Main Thread's being terminated,
then display "KeDelayExecutionThread"
Maybe memory addressing out of range, the bugs exists in the multithreading synchronization.

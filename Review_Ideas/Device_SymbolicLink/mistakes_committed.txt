# | IoDeleteDevice( pDeviceObjectTemp2 );
VOID, no value rerturned, the following section is invalid.
# | ntStatus = IoDeleteDevice(...);


Didn't know the basis strong.
# |  pDeviceObject->flag & = ~DO_DEVICE_INITIALIZING;

Triggered an compiling-time error, the space character ' ' between "&" and "=" should be left out
# |  pDeviceObject->flag &= ~DO_DEVICE_INITIALIZING;


MSDN says flag member in "_DEVICE_OBJECT" is named "Flags",



# | pDeviceObject->Flags &= ~DO_DEVICE_INITIALIZING;

Compiler doesn't identify 
# | pDeviceObject->flag &= ~DO_DEVICE_INITIALIZING;
Or
# | pDeviceObject->flags &= ~DO_DEVICE_INITIALIZING;


OK, non-error program compiled.

While debugging, it fail to start the driver service,

it suddenly strike on me that, recently I don't uninstall the driver after the first debug failed.
Thanks to I have made up a habit of debugging unstable driver inside VM...

Restoring VM's status, only to find it failed again...

As shown on DbgView, Error ID=-1073741773 happened on "SymbolicLink".

It was not until 11:00 AM that I find the reason that, it requires:
# | RtlInitUnicodeString( &usSymbolicLinkName, L"\\??\\MyDDKSymbolName");
Rather than:
# | RtlInitUnicodeString( &usSymbolicLinkName, L"\\??\\MyDDKDevice");

Wrong Unicode String, retry!



Another matter triggered, after look up in the DbgView, the output before IoDeleteDevice was left out.

It is supposed to be:
# | if ( !DriverObject )
that make sense,

instead of being 
# | if ( DriverObject )



I made it on 11:16 AM, June 07, 2014   !!!!
